# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This project is the submission to Peer-graded Assignment for Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" Course Project.
The aim of this project is to:
 - download datasets from a research on "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" (data are stored in UCI Machine Learning Repository)
 - process and clean those data
 - finally generate a tidy dataset containing just a subset of original information to be used for later analysis
